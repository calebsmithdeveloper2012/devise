Mobile Fu has serveral redirect issues with devise I found that replaceing one line fixes most these issues. 
The v2.2 branch is my main point of focus right now because that is the version of devise I use.

Use - gem 'devise', :git => "https://github.com/calebsmithdeveloper2012/devise.git", :branch => 'v2.2'
